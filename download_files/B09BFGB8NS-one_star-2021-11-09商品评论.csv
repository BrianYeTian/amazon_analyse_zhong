Dave U.,2021年9月3日 在美国审核,Specs are BS， product is poorly made and designed,I ordered an IFull m.2 enclosure drive for my NVMe drive. Drive rated 3k r/w， and when mounted internally performed as such. I previously purchased the manufacturer's enclosure and it only performed 1k r/w. I returned the enclosure. This drive said 10g r/w rating so when it was delivering slower than my other enclosure I was VERY disappointed. The two photos show the enclosures issues. The faster specs are my drive mounted internally， the slower setting are via this enclosure. Not great. Also isn't tool free， required using pliers to pull additional mounting screws. And， once you use the thermal paste and close this thing up， good luck ever opening it. Sucks， avoid this like the plague， must be a better one out there.,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
Tim Kvasnosky,2021年10月27日 在美国审核,M.2 NVMe & SATA SSD Enclosure NVME USB Adapter,I have my new Acer laptop with USB C and USB 3.1 support. I bought Samsung 970 Evo Plus to clone the small nvme 256gb on the laptop to new Samsung 2TB. I install Samsung data migration. My laptop can see the device enclosure but there is no Samsung nvme 2TB display at all. I check to use both usb c and usb 3.1 cable that goes with the device but none of them can see my Samsung nvme 2TB. I use other brand enclosure I bought from Amazon and this device can see my samsung nvme 2TB.,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
Tim Kvasnosky,2021年11月2日 在美国审核,Terrible enclosure， disconnects frequently,Bought it because they said the realtek chip was better， but it has been worse than other enclosures. Randomly disconnects while using it， and won’t connect after a while.,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
TL,2021年6月15日 在美国审核,Absolute garbage,My Samsung 980 EVO pro doesn’t fit properly so it is not recognized and I can’t initialize the drive. Don’t know what the raving reviews are about but this thing is cheap and doesn’t work. DO NOT BUY.,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
