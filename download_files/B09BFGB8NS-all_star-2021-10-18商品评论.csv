Tim Kvasnosky,2021年9月3日 在美国审核,Specs are BS， product is poorly made and designed,I ordered an IFull m.2 enclosure drive for my NVMe drive. Drive rated 3k r/w， and when mounted internally performed as such. I previously purchased the manufacturer's enclosure and it only performed 1k r/w. I returned the enclosure. This drive said 10g r/w rating so when it was delivering slower than my other enclosure I was VERY disappointed. The two photos show the enclosures issues. The faster specs are my drive mounted internally， the slower setting are via this enclosure. Not great. Also isn't tool free， required using pliers to pull additional mounting screws. And， once you use the thermal paste and close this thing up， good luck ever opening it. Sucks， avoid this like the plague， must be a better one out there.,1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
Russ,2021年6月11日 在美国审核,Quality enclosure,This is an interesting design， not my favourite but this clean and minimalist.The body is anodized aluminum and it is quality， it’s not cheesy like others. The inside side adapter is a plastic base and it too is precision made.When you plug it into your computer it works with ease basically ready to go with no fuse.It comes with a c to c port connector and a c port to a 2.0 USB port connector. Both are nice quality transfer cables I just wish they were longer by six inches .My favourite part is the thermal tape the unit comes with .This is a nice enclosure for your ssd. If you get this I don’t think you will be disappoint,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
Dave U.,2021年5月20日 在美国审核,Useful tool for working with NVMe cards,This is a very useful tool for working with NVMe cards. I got it so I could prepare an NVMe card for my new PC ahead of time before installing it in the system board's NVMe slot.Just one little issue: this device comes with two tiny black plastic doo-dads that are used to keep the NVMe card in place. With my NVMe cards I had to remove one of the two doo-dads otherwise it would have gotten in the way of the card. Then， when I removed the card to install it in my PC， the doo-dad slipped out of its slot and almost got lost. A word of advice: if you buy one of these devices， be very， very careful about these black plastic things lest you lose them. Without them the card won't stay in place so the device would be useless.,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
amzn hunter,2021年5月30日 在美国审核,Little adapter that makes my NVMe ssd portable, From another project I have a NVMe ssd with M.2. interface available. With this adapter it's now a 1TB portable ssd drive that fits into my point very easily. The package even comes with foam that connects the NVMe to the metal enclosure which I suppose acts as a heat sink as well. Slide out， put the NVMe in and lock it with the locknut. No screw driver needed in the whole operation! It even comes with 2 data cables， USB C-C， USBC-A. I don't know what more one can ask for.,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
Army Vet,2021年8月12日 在美国审核,Pleased with performance and price,I looked at a lot of enclosures on Amazon and found mixed reviews. I decided on this one and it is working fine. One tip so you don't make this mistake I did， make sure your SSD drive is properly seated in the enclosure. When I first inserted my drive in the enclosure， it appeared seated properly and I was able to lock it in place with the thumb screw at the top of the SSD drive. I plugged the enclosure into my USB port and Windows recognized the enclosure， but did not see the drive. At first I thought the enclosure was defective， but then I thought I should try reseating the drive. While doing so， I noticed a very small portion of the SSD connector was visible before I reseated it， but after reseating it， the SSD connectors were not visible.,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星

J. Salce,2021年5月20日 在美国审核,A fair priced， tool-less NVMe - SATA SSD Enclosure that delivers.,The IFULL M.2 NVMe & SATA SSD Enclosure is low priced， considering that supports both NVMe PCIe and SATA M.2 SSDsThe IFULL M.2 NVMe & SATA SSD Enclosure has a simple tool-free design that works. Just push and slide to open it or close it and twist the little knob to secure the M.2 SSD. It could hold different sizes M.2 SSDs (2242， 2260 & 2280). No need to deal with those tiny SSDs screws that will eventually disappear when you must need them.If you work in a computer shop and you have to swap drives often， then you will be delighted by the simple and easy to use design. It takes seconds to get a M.2 install and running.This enclosure comes with both USB Type-C to Type-C and USB Type-C to Type-A cables and it is compatible with Windows， MacOS and Android systems.It works on several platforms， so it could help when cloning M.2 drives， backing up your data or even copying your smartphone pictures and files.The IFULLM.2 SSD Enclosure can reach high speeds with the right drive (NVMe) and the right standard (USB C 3.1 Gen 2)I was able to copy a 9.6GB video file in 5 seconds (8.5 Gbit/s) on NVMe connected to a USB 3.2 Gen2 port on a ASRock B550 motherboard. On SATA it reached write speeds of 498 MB/s.I used several systems with USB 3.0， 3.1 and 3.2 Gen2 on both Type A and Type C ports.Depending on the USB interface and the drive used， the transfer speed could vary significantly.The enclosure comes with thermal padding. I did not use it， since none of the drives went above 40°C even when transferring files.Drives used:SK Hynix Gold P31 M.2 PCIe NVMeIntel SSD Pro 2500 M.2 SATAMicron 1100 M.2 SATADevices used:MacBook Pro (2017)Dell Inspiron 13 7000Oneplus 7TSamsung Galaxy S10AMD Ryzen system with a ASRock B550 motherboard.,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
L. Sweet,2021年7月10日 在美国审核,Worked great,The obvious use is to make an enormous， really fast USB drive. And for that purpose it works great.I had a more specific use. I was doing some system upgrades. One part of the upgrade was to replace my PCIe 3 2 TB NVMe drive with a faster PCIe 4 2 TB drive. The drive was my boot drive. Before upgrading I installed my new PCIe 4 drive into this enclosure. Plugged it in and the system recognized it instantly. I then used some drive cloning software to clone my old drive to the new drive.The cloning process ran without issue. Removed my new drive from this enclosure. Swapped out my old drive for my new drive， and my system booted right up. Fast and easyIt was simple to install the drive into the enclosure. Also easy to remove it when I was done. This is a very handy device for system builders.,5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星
Dada,2021年7月28日 在美国审核,Fast transfer rates and solid construction， great product， seller offers compensation for reviews, I added a Samsung m2 drive in this recently to take along with me for recent trip so I could offload files from SD cards to this drive. The file transfers to the m2 drive with this enclosure were very fast and the included cables made for easy accessibility with many devices.Additionally， I like the machined， rounded， aluminum case that makes for easy packing amongst other equipment and helps with heat dissipation. I did not attach the included thermal strip to my m2 drive， which may have helped with heat dissipation as the case does get quite warm when in use.,4.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星

Slide the case back on and you're done! I used it in a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port on my motherboard and it is so fast， it feels as fast as the drive did when it was installed in my old computer.
